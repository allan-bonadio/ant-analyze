			blurb: "This is one of the most popular functions for graphing.  It actually has a singularity at x = 0, but it's a removable singularity.  The limit as x goes to zero is 1 because sin(x) is roughly equal to x near x = 0 .  As long as the graph doesn't try to evaluate at exactly zero, it'll look fine.",

			title: "Sine of Reciprocal",
			formula: "sin(1/x)",
			blurb: "Because the reciprocal goes to infinity as you approach zero, the sine wave fluctuates wildly.  There is an essential singularity at x = 0; the value at zero is ambiguous, anywhere over -1 ... 1, and even beyond, if you approach from different angles over the complex plane.  The graph is almost impossible to draw near zero for that reason.",
